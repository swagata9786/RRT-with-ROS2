## Packages
- user_input_node: Handles user given start, goal, and grids
- planner_node: Computes the RRT* tree and finds optimal paths
- visualizer_node: Draws the grid, tree, and final path in real-time
## Build Guide 
- Clone the Repository
First, navigate to your ROS 2 workspace and clone the project:
```
cd /rrt_star_planner/src
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-rrt-star-repo.git
```
## How to Run
- Using a Launch File
Launch the RRT* node with predefined parameters:
```
ros2 launch rrt rrt_start.launch.py
```
This launch file automatically sets important parameters like grid size, start cell, and goal cell.

- Running Manually with Custom Parameters
Alternatively, runs the RRT* node directly and manually specify parameters:
```
ros2 run rrt rrt_star_node --ros-args \
-p start_cell_x:=3 \
-p start_cell_y:=2 \
-p goal_cell_x:=29 \
-p goal_cell_y:=42 \
-p rows:=50 \
-p cols:=30
```
- rows and cols define the size of the grid (50 rows Ã— 30 columns).
- start_cell_x, start_cell_y define the start position at cell (3, 2).
- goal_cell_x, goal_cell_y define the goal position at cell (29, 42).
